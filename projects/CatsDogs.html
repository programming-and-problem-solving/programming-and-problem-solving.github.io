&amp; Dogs" is a two-player board game similar to "Three
Musketeers" and based on the gaming principle of unequal forces:
the two players move by different rules and have different conditions
for winning.</span></span></p>

The board is a 7-by-7 grid in which the four corners and center
square are all initially occupied by Cats, and the remaining squares
are initially occupied by Dogs.</p>

The Cat player moves first. It can move one of the Cats to any
orthogonally (non-diagonal) adjacent space occupied by a Dog, which
is then removed from the board. Poor doggie.</p>

The Dog player wins if it can force three or more of the Cats to all
be in the same row or same column. The Cat player wins if no Cat can
move because there are no orthogonally adjacent squares occupied by a
Dog (assuming there are no rows or columns containing three or more
Cats).</p>

In this project, you will implement strategies for both the Cat and
Dog players; we will decide as a group which one to start with.</p>

Although you are free to use any approach you like, of course, you
should at least be aware of (if not familiar with) the "minimax"
game playing strategy, which is typically taught in AI courses and
involves looking ahead at possible board states based on the current
game state. Depending on how far ahead you look, it may take a very
long time for a player to decide on its next move. To make gameplay
tractable, there is currently a time limit of 5 seconds on each
player's move, but we can change that if necessary.</p>
